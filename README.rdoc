= event_utils

EventUtils is meant to provide modules and classes to help building services
on top of EventMachine without having to cope with some of the mechnics of
eventmachine itself.

the first implemented facility id EventUtils::DeferredLoop

it makes possible to perform action on groups of deferrable objects in an
intuitive way, and without having to take care of starting/stopping the
EventMachine reactor

example:

  d1 and d2 are two deferrables
  and we want to compare them but the comparaison is only feasible when
  d1 and d2 have both deferred status set.

  In this case the code will look like

  in_deferred_loop do
    waiting_for d1, d2 do
      d1 > d2
    end
  end
